                This is an initially misleading case. At any given moment, you CAN navigate somewhat easily, but it needs improvement. The one thing the site has going for it, the breadcrumb feature, fails to efficiently indicate which page you are currently on. There is also no way to index assignments, and overdue assignments are very inconsistently listed at all.

                For a multi-billion dollar corporation, UX issues at all are a surprise. But, if one looks closely, the cracks begin to show. For one, the UI fails to have a built-in method (or at least a dedicated, clearly-indicated one) to go back to the search results. The video links also lack any responsiveness to user input, leaving it unclear whether a click was registered at all.
